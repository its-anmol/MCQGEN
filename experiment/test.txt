8051 is one of the first and most popular microcontrollers also known as MCS-51. Intel introduced it in the year 1981. Initially, it came out as an N-type metal-oxide-semiconductor (NMOS) based microcontroller, but later versions were based on complementary metal-oxide-semiconductor(CMOS) technology. These microcontrollers were named 80C51, where C in the name tells that it is based on CMOS technology. It is an 8-bit microcontroller which means the data bus is 8-bit. Therefore, it can process 8 bits at a time. It is used in a wide variety of embedded systems like robotics, remote controls, the automotive industry, telecom applications, power tools, etc. 


It is referred to as a System on a Chip (SoC) microcontroller because it is a chip circuit/integrated circuit that holds many components of a computer together on a single chip. These components include a CPU, memory, input-output ports(I/O ports), timers, and secondary storage.
